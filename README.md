# Github Pages with pandoc

If you have some **very** basic markdown pages without images and stuff that
you wan't to publish on github this is the ticket.

## Repository Settings

In "Github Pages" set under "Build and deployment" set "Source" to
"Github Actions". Everything else should fall into place, be patient.
